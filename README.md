# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here, you can check out some of my projects. They range from random Xcode files
to test new frameworks, or simple apps I make to pass time. I also make cool
AI models and web apps powered by AI models through Jupyter notes which can be 
found here.

I also do algorithmic trading using the IBKR API, and occasionally upload some of the algorithms here.
